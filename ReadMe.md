# Amazon price tracker \ Python


Amazon product price tracker is a python language project that scrapes the price and title of a product from the URL provided and notifies the user via email in real-time. 

The basic approach is that it scrapes the required details such as product title and product price. After scraping, it logs in to the senders account and sends an email regarding the product price to the receiver.
Some packages used are Beautiful Soup (bs4), Requests, DateTime, and smtplib.
If you have these packages already installed you are good to go. Otherwise, you can simply install these packages using the following command:

$ pip install package-name

After that you can implement the code and you are good to go.
Good luck!
